Complete RAG Pipeline Demo - TechCorp PolicyCopilot
===================================================

This script demonstrates a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system
that combines all the concepts from previous labs:
- Document chunking
- Vector database storage
- Query processing
- Vector search
- Context augmentation
- Response generation

Run this script to see the complete RAG pipeline in action!
